In this segment, learning tablets are being utilized as supplementary educational tools to enhance traditional teaching methods. These devices support a wide range of subjects, from mathematics and science to language arts and history, through interactive and multimedia-rich applications. For K-12 students, tablets offer the advantage of personalized learning experiences, allowing students to work through lessons at their own pace.
